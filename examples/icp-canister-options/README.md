# Canister Options Example

This example demonstrates how to specify canister creation options using `icp`.

## Overview

This project consists of a single canister that is deployed with a number of creation options, such as `compute_allocation`, `memory_allocation`, and `freezing_threshold`.

## Instructions

First, start a local network in a separate terminal window:

```bash
icp network run
```

Then, deploy the canister:

```bash
icp deploy
```
