# Single-canister Project Example

This example demonstrates how to configure and deploy a single-canister project using `icp`.

## Overview

This project consists of a single, pre-built canister. The `icp.yaml` file at the root of the project defines the canister and its build configuration.

## Instructions

First, start a local network in a separate terminal window:

```bash
icp network run
```

Then, deploy the canister:

```bash
icp deploy
```
